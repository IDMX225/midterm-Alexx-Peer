    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>At Tails and Trails, I'm like sooooo passionate about getting your dog out of your crappy apartment for once in its life and onto beautiful hiking trails with actual grass and fresh air.  With 10+ years experience in walking dogs, I specialize in walking dogs, offering your dog the only escape from its miserable life alone with you, to explore nature while getting the exercise they need. From quiet parks in the old folks community, to the playground across the street from your condo development, we tailor each walk to your dog’s pace and preferences. Whether your dog is an experienced hiker or lazy and overweight, we’re here to provide a safe and exciting experience that your dog will probably never get again! Join us for the ultimate adventure your dog will love!</p>
